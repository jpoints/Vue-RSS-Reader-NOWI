<title>A Waiting Game for Offshore Wind Jobs</title>
<link>https://newbedfordlight.org/a-waiting-game-for-offshore-wind-jobs/</link>
<description>IN NEW BEDFORD: Training for a chance to work offshore - In December of 2019, when the Vineyard Wind project was stuck behind federal delays under the Trump administration, apprentice pile driver Welch hopped into his Toyota Camry to make the late afternoon commute from Somerville (his job site at the time) to Mass Maritime Academy in Buzzards Bay. Through his union, he was enrolled in a training course for the offshore wind industry that would also count toward his mandatory apprenticeship hours.”  A Waiting Game for Offshore Wind Jobs by New Bedford Light looks at those training now for future employment opportunities in the field in Massachusetts.</description>

<title>East Coast Offshore Wind Threatened by Transmission Bottlenecks</title>
<link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/atlantic-transmission-bottlenecks-threaten-offshore-wind-growth</link>
<description>More renewable energy and more locally generated power requires a shift in transmission strategy along with new grid technology like battery storage to dispatch power at the optimal times. Some have called for officials to study a “backbone,” or shared transmission lines, that would link offshore parcels stretching from Massachusetts to North Carolina.</description>

<description>IN FALL RIVER: Mayflower Wind wants to use eight acres at Brayton Point in Somerset, over the Braga Bridge from Fall River, as the location where subsea power cables will connect to a new onshore, high-voltage direct current converter station. Steven Collins, executive vice president of redevelopment for Brayton Point LLC, said the latest offshore wind developments — and especially Prysmian Group’s plan to create a manufacturing site at Brayton Point — bode well for his company and the entire region.</description>

<title>Baker-Polito Administration Announces Historic Selection of Offshore Wind Projects to Bring Clean, Affordable Power to the Commonwealth</title>
<link>https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-historic-selection-of-offshore-wind-projects-to-bring-clean-affordable-power-to-the-commonwealth</link>
<description>Two Selected Projects Will Deliver 1,600 Megawatts of Clean Energy to Massachusetts’ Grid. “Massachusetts has been a national leader in the offshore wind industry and today’s announcement is another major milestone with the selection of two projects that double the amount of offshore wind power secured by the Commonwealth,” said Governor Charlie Baker. “The bipartisan energy legislation our Administration worked with the Legislature to pass in 2016 has unlocked record low pricing and significant economic investment through three separate procurements, and the projects selected today further illustrate the potential offshore wind presents for our climate goals, our local workforce and our port communities.”</description>

<description>Herald News: GUEST OPINION by Lloyd Mendes, SRPEDD Commissioner - “Don't assume that only big companies can profit from offshore wind. Vineyard Wind works with a local non-profit to link major contractors with local suppliers. Bristol Community College trains businesses on the types of goods and services needed in offshore wind energy. Businesses from Westport to Taunton are turning toward the sea; look at Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s offshore wind supply chain directory.&quot;</description>

<title>So, You Want to be an Offshore Wind Turbine Tech?</title>
<link>https://newbedfordlight.org/so-you-want-to-be-an-offshore-wind-turbine-tech/</link>
<description>The New Bedford Light takes an in-depth look at training for an offshore wind energy career: In 2023, wind turbine technicians for the Vineyard Wind project are scheduled to start their jobs on the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm. They will take a crew transfer vessel (or possibly a helicopter) from Vineyard Haven to one of the roughly 700-foot-tall turbine towers about 15 miles out to sea.</description>

<description>The US Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in January gave final permitting approval to South Fork – New York’s first offshore wind farm. It’s now the second US offshore wind project authorized by the US government to begin construction. It will be located about 35 miles east of Montauk Point and will deliver clean energy directly to the electric grid in East Hampton via a single, 138kV alternating current (AC) transmission line.</description>
